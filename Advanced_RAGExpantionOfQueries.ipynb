I wrote a letter in September 2023 to \\nmark the occasion, reflecting on a quarter century \\nof technological progress. I believe it’s a great \\ncelebration of all we’ve achieved as a company over \\nthe past 25 years – so we’re reprinting it here. \\nSince it was published, we’ve continued to make \\nincredible progress in building and deploying AI \\nacross all of our products, including Search, Cloud, \\nand YouTube. We’re also growing our subscriptions \\nbusiness and seeing great momentum across \\nour Cloud business to bring AI advances to \\norganizations around the world. Thanks to our \\nstockholders, who have supported us and our \\nmission over the last 25 years – looking forward \\nto so much more to come!1Annual Report 2023\\n To everyone around \\nthe world who uses our \\nproducts, our employees, \\nand our partners:\\nIt’s a time for some gratitude, and a moment to reflect.\\nI’ve been thinking a lot about how far technology has \\ncome over the last 25 years and how people adapt to \\nit. Years ago, when I was studying in the U.S., my dad – \\nwho was back in India – got his first email address. \\nI was really excited to have a faster (and cheaper) \\nway to communicate with him, so I sent a message.\\nAnd then I waited … and waited. It was two full days \\nbefore I got this reply:\\n“Dear Mr. Pichai, email received. All is well.”\\nPerplexed by the delay and the formality, I called him \\nup to see what happened. He told me that someone \\nat his work had to bring up the email on their office \\ncomputer, print it out, and then deliver it to him. \\nMy dad dictated a response, which the guy wrote \\ndown and eventually typed up to send back to me.\\nFast-forward to a few months ago: I was with my \\nteenage son. He saw something interesting, took \\nsome quick pictures, and shared them with his friends. \\nThen they exchanged a few messages, and it all \\nseemed faster than the time it would take me just \\nto pull out my phone.\\nHow I communicated with my dad all those years ago \\ncompared with how my son communicates today \\nshows just how much change can happen across \\ngenerations. Technology that takes us years to \\nadapt to is second nature for our kids. Ideas my dad \\nmarveled at as science fiction – taking a call from your \\nwatch or telling your car to play your favorite song – \\nmake my children shrug.\\nThose shrugs give me great hope for the future. \\nThey set a high bar for what the next generation will \\nbuild and invent ... and I can’t wait to see what will \\nmake their children shrug, too.\\nAn essential truth of innovation is that the moment \\nyou push the boundary of a technology, it soon goes \\nfrom extraordinary to ordinary. That’s why Google has \\nnever taken our success for granted.\\n[Letter originally published September 2023]  \\nThis month, Google will celebrate our 25th birthday. \\nIt’s a huge privilege to reach this milestone, made \\npossible by the people who use our products and \\nchallenge us to keep innovating, the hundreds of \\nthousands of Googlers past and present who have \\ngiven their talents to building those products, and our \\npartners, who believe in our mission as much as we do.\\n→\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   1AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   1 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM2\\nIt all started \\nwith a search\\nLarry and Sergey first wrote down our mission \\n25 years ago: to organize the world’s information \\nand make it universally accessible and useful. \\nThey had an ambitious vision for a new kind of search \\nengine to help people make sense of the waves of \\ninformation moving online. The product they built, \\nGoogle Search, went on to help billions of people \\naround the world get answers to their questions.\\nFor a few years, I was one of those people experiencing \\nGoogle like any other user of the web. I remember \\nfeeling blown away by Google’s ability to find the best \\nanswer for the most esoteric questions, from a tiny \\ndetail buried in a store’s customer service page to an \\nobscure football rule.\\nThe questions I’ve asked Google have evolved over \\ntime: “How do you fix a dripping faucet?” “Fastest \\nroute to Stanford Hospital?” “Ways to calm a crying \\nbaby?” And right around spring of 2003, perhaps: \\n“How to ace a Google interview?” And over time, \\nGoogle got much better at answering them.\\nIt’s been inspiring to see what people have done with \\nthe answers to their questions, be it to find health care \\nor comfort in difficult times, learn new skills, pursue \\nnew career paths, or start new businesses. The idea \\nthat a student in rural Indonesia could access the \\nsame information as a professor at Stanford was \\nrevolutionary and has changed lives and our world \\nfor the better. It’s opened up access to education and \\nentrepreneurship like nothing else before it or since.\\nSearch also laid the foundations for Google to make \\nan economic impact beyond our own walls. Our \\nadvertising platforms and tools started out with a \\npremise as simple as Search itself: to help businesses \\nreach customers who were already looking for the \\nkinds of products and services they offer. It was \\na platform that appealed to small businesses in \\nparticular, like the mail-order business selling lobsters \\nthat was the first to sign up. And also like Search itself, \\nthe ability for any business to advertise online has had \\na truly transformational impact, helping millions of \\nbusinesses become part of the digital economy.\\nA quarter century \\nof questions\\nSearch is still at the core of our mission, and it’s still \\nour biggest moonshot with so much more to do.\\nOf course, Google today is more than a search box. \\nWe have 15 Google products that each serve more \\nthan half a billion people and businesses, and six that \\nserve more than 2 billion users each.\\nLike most Google searches, all those products started \\nwith a question, too. With Gmail it was: Could we offer \\n1 GB of storage to every person? In 2004, when Gmail \\nlaunched, that volume of storage was over 100X what \\nmost other free webmail services were offering!\\nThen a few years later, we saw an opportunity to \\ndramatically improve web browsers – and in turn \\nthe web – for people everywhere. So with Chrome \\nwe asked: Could we build a browser that made the \\nweb better, with simplicity, speed, and security at its \\ncore? Right before launch, I had my own question: \\nWill people use this?\\nYouTube dared to ask: What if we gave everyone \\na way to share what they know with the world? \\nAnd today, it’s become a powerful platform for \\nlearning and knowledge.\\nThe questions have kept coming, and we’ve kept \\nimproving and expanding our products with new \\nanswers: What if Google Maps enabled people to \\nsee every street in the world in detail? What if we \\nbuilt a translation tool that allowed people to access \\ninformation and communicate in multiple languages? \\nWhat if you could search and find all your old photos \\nby simply describing what you wanted to see?\\nWe’ve also asked ourselves how we could best share \\nour tools, breakthroughs, and infrastructure with \\nothers. Google was built in the cloud from the start, \\neven though we only launched our Cloud business \\nin 2008. Today, Google Cloud has become one of \\nthe top enterprise companies in the world. Partners \\nacross industries are using Google technology to \\nimprove customer support and supply chain efficiency, \\nreduce their carbon footprint, build new applications, \\nand get more done with AI. Like our advertising clients \\nbefore them, Cloud’s partners are operating better, \\ngrowing faster, and creating jobs with our help.\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   2AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   2 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM3Annual Report 2023\\nOf course, not every question we asked ended up \\nas a success. In any 25-year journey, you take a \\nfew lumps, learn the lessons, and work to do better. \\nRemember Google Wave?\\nWe’ve also faced hard questions about our future as \\na company. In the 2000s, it was: How long can the \\nweb really last? In the 2010s, people asked if we could \\nadapt to the era of mobile computing and whether \\nsearch was “over”? Each time, we’ve answered by \\ncoming back even stronger. We’ve done this guided by \\na singular focus on our mission, our belief in applying \\ndeep computer science to make people’s lives better, \\nand a healthy disregard for the impossible.\\nA healthy disregard \\nfor the impossible\\nThat healthy disregard is why we’ve been able to take \\non problems others couldn’t – or wouldn’t. There was, \\nfor example, this impossible idea of putting a powerful \\ncomputer in everyone’s pocket, no matter their \\nincome or internet connectivity. Today, Android runs \\non 3 billion devices all over the world, from the latest \\nfoldables to entry-level phones. It’s been at the core \\nof our efforts to make the internet more accessible for \\neveryone and inspired other transformative products. \\nLikewise, Chromebooks made computing available \\nto schools all over the world. And Google Pixel puts \\nthe best of our latest technology – machine learning-\\npowered cameras, speech recognition, transcription \\ncapabilities, tensor chips, and more – directly into \\npeople’s hands.\\nWhich brings us to AI. Google has been investing \\nin AI since almost the beginning. We were one of \\nthe first to use machine learning in our products, \\nstarting in the early 2000s, for spelling corrections, \\nimproving the quality of ads, and showing \\nsuggestions and recommendations.\\nThen, in the early 2010s, there was real excitement \\naround deep neural networks. In 2012, a few of us \\nwent along to a demo in a meeting room near Charlie’s, \\nour main campus café. I remember watching in awe \\nas the Research team showed us the progress they’d \\nmade with image recognition, driven by breakthroughs \\nin neural networks. It was the first moment I thought \\nto myself: This is really going to change everything!\\nI had a similar feeling when I saw the groundbreaking, \\ninterdisciplinary research happening at DeepMind, \\nfocused on understanding the nature of intelligence. \\nThis progress deeply influenced my thinking, when \\nI became CEO in 2015, that Google should pivot to \\nbe an AI-first company.\\nMore questions followed. How to power this new \\ngeneration of computing? So we invented Tensor \\nProcessing Units, or TPUs – which provided dramatic \\nperformance improvements of 30X to 80X for \\nmachine learning over other hardware at the time, \\nand powered the AlphaGo computer, which beat the \\nGo world champion Lee Sedol in 2016. Around the \\nsame time, we released our landmark Transformer \\npaper in 2017, which created the neural network \\narchitecture that’s the foundation for most of the \\ngenerative AI and large language models today.\\nMany of these technology breakthroughs have led \\nto some of our most incredible product innovations. \\nSearch results for complex queries got much more \\nhelpful because of large language models like MUM \\nand BERT. We’ve created entirely new ways for people \\nto express what they’re looking for through voice, \\nimages, and even asking questions about what they \\nsee with multisearch. Now generative AI is helping us \\nreimagine our core products in exciting ways – from \\nour new Search Generative Experience (SGE) to “Help \\nMe Write” in Gmail. And earlier this year, we launched \\nBard, an early experiment that lets people collaborate \\nwith generative AI.\\nMy favorite moments are seeing how our products \\ncan make a difference in people’s lives: Whether it’s \\na busy parent taking a photo of their craft drawer and \\nusing Bard to inspire a rainy day project for their kids; \\na traveler using Lens to translate a train schedule in \\na foreign country; or, more profoundly, a family able \\nto hear the voice of a man with ALS, thanks to our \\nresearch on speech recognition and synthesis.\\nDesigning products that help people at scale is both \\na privilege and a responsibility. People have their own \\nquestions: Can we trust these new technologies? \\nWe think deeply about how to build responsible \\ntechnology from the start, whether it’s making sure \\neveryone’s information is protected and secure, \\nor keeping people safe from bad actors online.→\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   3AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   3 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM4\\nMaking AI more helpful for everyone – and deploying \\nit responsibly – is the most important way we’ll deliver \\non our mission for the next 10 years and beyond.\\nAnd now AI will allow us, \\nand others, to ask questions like:\\nHow could every student have access to a \\npersonal tutor, in any language, and on any topic?\\nHow could we enable entrepreneurs \\nto develop new forms of clean energy?\\nWhat tools could we invent to help people design \\nand create new products and grow new businesses?\\nHow can fields like transportation \\nand agriculture be reimagined?\\nHow could we help communities predict \\nand prepare for natural disasters?\\nAs these new frontiers come into view, we have \\na renewed invitation to act boldly and responsibly \\nto improve as many lives as possible and to keep \\nasking those big questions.\\nOur search for answers will drive extraordinary \\ntechnology progress over the next 25 years.\\nAnd in 2048, if, somewhere in the world, a teenager \\nlooks at all we’ve built with AI and shrugs, we’ll know \\nwe succeeded. And then we’ll get back to work.\\nThanks for an amazing 25,\\nSundar Pichai\\nThis also includes engaging in the important debates \\nabout how those technologies will shape our society \\nand then finding the answers together. AI is a key part \\nof this. As excited as we are about the potential of AI \\nto benefit people and society, we understand that \\nAI, like any early technology, poses complexities and \\nrisks. Our development and use of AI must address \\nthese risks, and help to develop the technology \\nresponsibly. The AI principles we launched in 2018 \\nare an important part of how we do this. These \\nprinciples prompt questions like: Will it be helpful to \\npeople and benefit society, or could it lead to harm in \\nany way? They also shape our product development \\nand AI applications, and guide us in finding solutions \\nto emerging issues. For example, just last week we \\nintroduced SynthID, a tool for watermarking and \\nidentifying AI-generated images, which will help \\naddress an important issue around transparency. \\nWe’ll continue to engage with experts and the \\ncommunity to keep learning and improving.\\nLooking ahead\\nAs we look ahead, I’ve been reflecting on the \\ncommitment from our original founders’ letter in 2004: \\n“to develop services that improve the lives of as many \\npeople as possible – to do things that matter.”\\nWith AI, we have the opportunity to do things that \\nmatter on an even larger scale.\\nWe’re just beginning to see what the next wave \\nof technology is capable of and how quickly it can \\nimprove. One million people are already using \\ngenerative AI in Google Workspace to write and \\ncreate. Flood forecasting now covers places where \\n460+ million people live. A million researchers have \\nused the AlphaFold database, which covers 200 \\nmillion predictions of protein structures, helping with \\nadvances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic \\nresistance, fight malaria, and more. And we’ve \\ndemonstrated how AI can help the airline industry \\nto decrease contrails from planes, an important tool \\nfor fighting climate change.\\nStill, there is so much more ahead. Over time, AI will be \\nthe biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. \\nIt’s bigger than the shift from desktop computing to \\nmobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself. \\nIt’s a fundamental rewiring of technology and an \\nincredible accelerant of human ingenuity.\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   4AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   4 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PMUNITED STATES\\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\\nWashington, D.C. 20549\\nFORM 10-K \\n\\xa0ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023\\nOR\\n\\xa0TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\\nFor the transition period from __________ to __________.\\nCommission file number: 001-37580\\n(State or other jurisdiction of \\nincorporation or organization)\\n(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) \\n(Address of principal executive offices, including zip \\ncode) \\n(Registrant’s telephone number, including area code)\\nCommission \\nfile number:\\n(I.R.S.

We do not \\nintend to become one.” That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big \\nproblems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, an AI-first company. \\nWe continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google \\nServices and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet’s structure is about helping \\neach of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence. \\nAccess\\tand\\tTechnology for\\tEveryone\\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and small. Our mission \\nto organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were \\nfounded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps \\npeople get things done. \\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need \\nto increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make sense \\nof the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides people with \\nentertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done \\nseamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a person’s day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud \\nhelps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are \\ncontinually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities \\nand have invested more than $150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\\nMaking AI\\tHelpful for\\tEveryone\\nAI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across the world, \\nand for our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a decade and \\nmaking them available to our users. Our journey began in 2001, when machine learning was first incorporated into Google \\nSearch to suggest better spellings to users searching the web. Today, AI in our products is used by billions of people \\nglobally through features like autocomplete suggestions in Google Search; translation across 133 languages in Google \\nTranslate; and organization, searching, and editing in Google Photos.\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are an exciting aspect of our work in AI based on deep learning architectures, such as the \\nTransformer, a neural network architecture that we introduced in 2017 that helped with language understanding. This led to \\nthe Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped Search understand the intent of \\nuser search queries better than ever before.\\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including Google \\nCloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-optimized \\ninfrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\\nWe believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal, scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For example, in 2020, \\nGoogle DeepMind’s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then, we have open-sourced to \\nthe scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold’s protein structures which are used to work on everything from accelerating \\nnew malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-eating enzymes. As another example, AI \\ncan also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful information, predicting climate-related events, \\nand optimizing climate action. Using advanced AI and geospatial analysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting \\nmodels that can provide early warning and real-time flooding information to communities and individuals. \\n1Alphabet 2023 Annual ReportAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we deliver on \\nour mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With a bold and responsible \\napproach, we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\\nDeliver\\tthe\\tMost\\tAdvanced, Safe,\\tand\\tResponsibleAI\\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and rigorously tested \\nat scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we launched Gemini, our \\nmost capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and \\nseamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including text, code, audio, images, \\nand video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and \\nannounced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, \\ncustomers, and developers.\\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the \\npositive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles. We published these in 2018, as one \\nof the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety, and avoidance of harms above business \\nconsiderations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible, we believe it is possible — and in \\nfact critical — to embrace that tension productively.\\nEnable\\tOrganizations\\tand\\tDevelopers\\tto\\tInnovate\\ton\\tGoogle Cloud\\nAI is not only a powerful enabler, it is also a major platform shift. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, \\nand the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on making it easy and \\nscalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced computing infrastructure and \\nexpanding access to Google’s latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our own products. Our Vertex AI platform \\ngives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, and deploy applications using generative AI models and services such \\nas Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers \\nto write, test, document, and operate software.\\nImprove\\tKnowledge,\\tLearning,\\tCreativity,\\tand\\tProductivity\\nThings that we now consider routine – like spell check, mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google Translate, and \\nGoogle Maps – all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users as we \\ncontinue to deliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\\nWhile we have been integrating AI into our products for years, we are now embedding the power of generative AI to \\ncontinue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace helps \\nusers write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Bard allows users to collaborate with \\nexperimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration. Dream Screen, a \\nnew experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts by \\ntyping an idea into a prompt.\\nWe also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses — \\nand we make that even easier with AI. With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign goals and share \\ntheir creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across all of Google’s \\nproperties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes, helping them easily \\ncreate uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products — for free. Additionally, we are experimenting with Search and \\nShopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and conversational mode in Search Generative \\nExperience.\\nBuild the Most\\tHelpful\\tPersonal\\tComputing\\tPlatforms\\tand\\tDevices\\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on top of it. \\nOur latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as Best Take, \\nMagic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome operating systems with \\nnew AI-forward user experiences. \\n2 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVMoonshots\\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism \\nleads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People \\nthought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have \\nmatured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. Our early investments in AI \\nstarted out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to future developments. We continue \\nto look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the application of AI to our products and services, \\nas well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As we said in the original founders’ letter, we will not shy \\naway from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our long-term success.\\nPrivacy\\tand Security\\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-term \\nfinancial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly \\nupholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people \\nin control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, giving \\nthem tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password \\nsecurity features.\\nGoogle\\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\\nGoogle\\tServices\\nServing Our\\tUsers\\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people worldwide. \\nOur product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. \\nGoogle Services’ core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, \\nGoogle Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the world.\\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. While Google \\nSearch started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical advancements and \\nproduct innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. We first expanded \\nfrom traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller screens. As new \\ntypes of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple content types, like news, \\nimages, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search modalities, like voice and visual \\nsearch, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive ways. We took that a step further with \\nmultisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. Large language models like BERT and \\nMultitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more natural language queries, vastly improving the \\nquality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people to find what they are looking for.\\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation \\nof digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are consuming many forms \\nof digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music, reading books, and using \\napps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and \\nfind great digital content.\\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to invest in \\nplatforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as growing \\nour family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people’s lives easier by combining \\nthe best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, such as the new \\nPixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and the Pixel Watch 2. Creating products and services that people rely on every day is a journey that \\nwe are investing in for the long-term.\\n3Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVHow We\\tMake\\tMoney\\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital \\nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide \\nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads \\nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our advertising \\nbusiness for more than a decade. Products like Performance Max and Product Studio use the full power of our AI to help \\nadvertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on \\nGoogle Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners’ properties (“Google Network properties”). \\nWe continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so \\nadvertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\\n• Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with \\nadvertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads \\ntools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\\n• Brand\\tadvertising helps enhance users’ awareness of and affinity for advertisers’ products and services, through \\nvideos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital \\nvideos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns. \\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus \\non creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid \\ntraffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where \\nads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\\nIn addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising, including:\\n•consumer\\tsubscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music \\nand Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n• platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases; and\\n• devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\\nGoogle Cloud\\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from \\nconsumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools and other cloud services. \\nCustomers use five key capabilities from Google Cloud.\\n• AI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to enable \\ncustomers to run workloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be used to migrate and \\nmodernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models. \\n• Cybersecurity: helps customers detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, with AI \\nintegrated to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack paths, as \\nwell as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats. \\n• Databases\\tand\\tAnalytics: provides a variety of different types of databases — relational, key-value, in-memory — to \\nstore and manage data for different types of applications. Our Data Cloud also unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data \\ngovernance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud.\\n• CollaborationTools: Google Workspace and Duet AI in Google Workspace provide easy-to-use, secure communication \\nand collaboration tools, including apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more. These tools enable secure \\nhybrid and remote work, boosting productivity and collaboration. AI has been used in Google Workspace for years \\nto improve grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart Reply, Smart Compose, and malware and \\nphishing protection in Gmail. Duet AI in Google Workspace helps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, \\nand have richer meetings.\\n• AI\\tPlatform\\tand\\tDuet AI\\tfor\\tGoogle\\tCloud: Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, \\nand deploy applications using generative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI \\nfor Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, document, and operate software.\\n4 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVOther\\tBets\\nAcross Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries from \\nimproving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change. Alphabet’s investment in \\nthe portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D \\nphase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful \\nbusinesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent \\nmembers and outside investors. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some \\nof them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are \\ngenerated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\\nCompetition\\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition \\nin every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\\n• general purpose search engines and information services;\\n• vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may \\nnavigate directly to rather than go through Google;\\n• online advertising platforms and networks;\\n• other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers typically \\nadvertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\\n• digital content and application platform providers;\\n• providers of enterprise cloud services;\\n• developers and providers of AI products and services;\\n• companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have \\ndeveloped proprietary platforms;\\n• providers of digital video services; \\n• social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through \\ntraditional search engines;\\n• providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and \\n• digital assistant providers.\\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies \\nto the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting \\nand\\xa0retaining:\\n• users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our \\nadvertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\\n• advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their \\nadvertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\\n• content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate \\nrevenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\\nFor additional information about competition, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \\nOngoing Commitment\\tto Sustainability\\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our core \\nvalues at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on sustainability and \\nclimate change since Google’s founding more than 25 years ago. \\nOur sustainability work is focused on empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners and \\ncustomers, and working to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain.\\n5Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVIn 2020, we shared our aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of their \\ncarbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to contribute \\nmeaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain. \\nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, by 2030. \\nTo\\xa0accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 absolute \\nemissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon \\nremoval solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We have formally committed to the Science Based Targets \\ninitiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target. \\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy. Since 2017, we have \\nmatched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an annual \\nbasis. However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind across the \\nregions where we operate—and because of the variable supply of these resources—we still need to rely on carbon-emitting \\nenergy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) on every grid \\nwhere we operate by 2030.\\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path to net-zero \\nemissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where they involve \\nbuilding new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we expect our \\nemissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater volume we \\nconsume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the quality of water \\nand health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate. \\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains. Our circularity \\nprinciples focus on designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and promoting \\nhealthy materials—for our data centers, workplaces, and products.\\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including Google’s \\nEnvironmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual \\nReport on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about risks and \\nuncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual \\nReport on Form 10-K.\\nCulture and Workforce\\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage \\nthe iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees can have \\nfulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to take care \\nof the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and development, \\nresources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive compensation \\nprograms help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to \\ntechnical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality training and support to \\nmanagers to build and strengthen their capabilities—ranging from courses for new managers, to learning resources that \\nhelp them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\\nAt Alphabet, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a \\nworkforce that is representative of the users we serve. More information on Google’s approach to diversity can be found in \\nour annual diversity reports, available publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not incorporated \\nby reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, Alphabet had 182,502 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee representation \\nobligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining an open culture, \\nand listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and we communicate \\ninformation about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\\n6 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVWhen necessary we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not have \\nappropriate in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations, content \\nmoderation, customer support, and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when we need to \\ncover short-term leaves, when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate special projects. We \\nchoose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google’s Supplier Code of Conduct. \\nWe continually make improvements to promote a respectful and positive working environment for everyone — employees, \\nvendors, and temporary staff alike.\\nGovernment\\tRegulation\\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations covering \\na wide variety of subjects, and the scope of this coverage continues to broaden with continuing new legal and regulatory \\ndevelopments in the U.S. and internationally. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face increasingly \\nheightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. \\nMany of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the courts, remain \\nuncertain. Particularly with regard to AI; climate change and sustainability; competition; consumer protection; content \\nmoderation; data privacy and security; news publications; and reporting on human capital and diversity, we have seen \\nan increase in new and evolving laws and regulations, as well as related enforcement actions and investigations, being \\nproposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the world.\\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase our \\ncost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models, \\ncause us to change our business practices, affect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise harm our \\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors; Trends in \\nOur Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our \\nproprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international \\ntrademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights.

Many of our advertisers, companies that \\ndistribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at \\nany time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased \\nnumbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their \\navailable alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as our initiatives to phase out \\nthird-party cookies, as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, \\nand may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed \\nthat make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services \\nhave integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital \\nadvertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our \\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic \\nconditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts \\nour advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nWe face\\tintense\\tcompetition.\\tIf\\twe\\tdo\\tnot\\tcontinue\\tto\\tinnovate\\tand\\tprovide\\tproducts\\tand\\tservices\\tthat\\t\\nare\\tuseful\\tto users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our\\nbusiness,\\tfinancial\\tcondition,\\tand\\toperating\\tresults.\\t\\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, \\nshifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately \\nanticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a \\ntimely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products \\nand services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and R&D, including through \\nacquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services. \\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range \\nfrom large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and \\nwell-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our \\ncompetitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic arrangements; continuing to invest \\nheavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property and competition claims (whether or not \\nmeritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies \\nin enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without \\ncommensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and \\nprovide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before we do. \\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to integrate AI \\ncapabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and require \\nsignificant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs and expectations of our \\nexisting users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for our products and services and \\nfor our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party equipment and technical infrastructure. \\nAdditionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or \\nmore cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary \\nrights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI products and services.\\n8 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the \\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and existing \\ntechnologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen \\nto be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products and services, and \\nforce us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products \\nand services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users, \\nadvertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nOur\\tongoing\\tinvestment\\tin\\tnew\\tbusinesses,\\tproducts,\\tservices,\\tand\\ttechnologies\\tis\\tinherently\\trisky,\\tand\\t\\ncould\\tdivert\\tmanagement\\tattention\\tand\\tharm\\tour\\tbusiness,\\tfinancial\\tcondition, and operating results.\\t\\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies in a wide range \\nof industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses, such as building AI \\ncapabilities into new and existing products and services, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and \\nservices that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments ultimately \\nmay not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may \\nincur unanticipated liabilities. Innovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user behavior and \\naffect our revenue trends. These endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources \\nand management attention from current operations, different monetization models, and the use of alternative investment, \\ngovernance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise \\naccomplish their objectives.\\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, \\nwhich is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of \\ntechnological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short product life cycles, \\nevolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the \\npart of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide devices that compete effectively. \\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including \\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to support these tools \\nand technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services, invest \\nin cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the same time, our competitors \\nare rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and constantly \\nevolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives. Further, our business \\nwith public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be \\nsubject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, \\nfinancial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments, build \\nnew products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign \\noperating requirements. \\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. \\nThese investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our offerings, \\nmany of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to compete \\neffectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability. \\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, legal, \\nregulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. \\nBecause all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will \\nbe successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur\\trevenue\\tgrowth\\trate\\tcould\\tdecline\\tover\\ttime,\\tand\\twe\\tmay\\texperience\\tdownward\\tpressure\\ton\\tour\\t\\noperating\\tmargin in the\\tfuture.\\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the devices and \\nmodalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines in advertiser \\nspending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our products and \\nservices; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services. \\n9Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such as an \\nincrease in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our business into \\nnew fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer subscription products, as \\nwell as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. \\nIn particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our consolidated margins \\ndue to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins \\nfrom increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs for many aspects of our business. Further, certain \\nof our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also \\nnot be able to execute our efforts to re-engineer our cost base successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and \\nthe evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative \\nof our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and \\nMonetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \\nOur\\tintellectual\\tproperty\\trights\\tarevaluable,\\tand\\tany\\tinability to\\tprotect\\tthem could\\treduce\\tthe\\tvalue\\tof\\t\\nour\\tproducts,\\tservices, and\\tbrands\\tas\\twell\\tas\\taffect\\tour\\tability\\tto\\tcompete.\\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. \\nVarious events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, \\nand technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our \\nproducts and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect \\nour proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, \\nit is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or \\ncopyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the \\nscope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. \\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other \\nsensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these \\ntrade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could \\nbecome so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have ruled that “Google” \\nis a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different \\ndetermination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the \\nword “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. \\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, \\nprotecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our \\nintellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nOur\\tbusiness depends\\ton\\tstrong\\tbrands,\\tand\\tfailing\\tto\\tmaintain\\tand\\tenhance\\tour\\tbrands\\twould\\thurt\\tour\\t\\nability\\tto\\texpand\\tour\\tbase\\tof\\tusers,\\tadvertisers,\\tcustomers,\\tcontent\\tproviders,\\tand\\tother\\tpartners.\\t\\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands \\nwithin Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and \\ninnovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and \\nother partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of factors, including, \\namong others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and \\ndevelopments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond appropriately to the \\nsharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by \\nadvertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands. \\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \\noperating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide \\nhigh-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range \\nof\\xa0settings. \\nWe face\\ta\\tnumber\\tof\\tmanufacturing\\tand\\tsupply\\tchain risks\\tthat\\tcould\\tharm\\tour\\tbusiness,\\tfinancial\\t\\ncondition,\\tand\\toperating\\tresults.\\t\\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply \\nboth our products and our services. \\n10 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices and servers and networking equipment used \\nin our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to assemble the devices \\nand equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the supply of components and distribution of our \\nproducts and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the \\nnecessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to \\nfinancial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements \\nwith\\xa0them. \\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, quality issues, and/or longer \\nlead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, manufacturing \\ncapacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, \\nsanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, forced labor concerns, sustainability sourcing requirements, \\ngeopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change (such as sea level \\nrise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire \\nprevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes in the financial or business condition of \\nour suppliers. Some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our devices are available from only one \\nor limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain \\ndisruption. A significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or \\nexpansions and delay consumer product availability. \\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions. \\nWe may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change, \\nchanged consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of our \\nhardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of sales of our \\ndevices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or \\nother financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial condition \\nand operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on \\nvolume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply. \\nOur devices have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations. \\nSometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality \\nof our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective or require a recall, it \\ncould harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and \\npractices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, \\nenvironmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of \\nlaw or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and \\ndamage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to \\nsell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims. \\nInterruption\\tto,\\tinterference\\twith,\\tor\\tfailure\\tof\\tour\\tcomplexinformation\\ttechnology and\\tcommunications\\t\\nsystems could\\thurt\\tour ability to effectively\\tprovideour products and services, which could\\tharm\\tour\\t\\nreputation, financial\\tcondition,\\tand\\toperating results.\\t\\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation \\nof our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or \\ninterruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, \\ngeopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects of climate change (such as sea level \\nrise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire \\nprevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, utility outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, \\nsoftware bugs, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or \\nother attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major \\nearthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts \\nof vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or \\ndisruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully \\nredundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster \\n11Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVor pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy \\ninterruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained \\nin the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our \\nservices or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively offering products and providing \\nservices, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur\\tinternational\\toperations\\texpose\\tusto\\tadditional\\trisks\\tthat\\tcould\\tharm\\tour\\tbusiness,financial\\tcondition,\\nand\\toperating\\tresults.\\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. \\nInternational revenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues in 2023. In addition to risks \\ndescribed elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\\n• restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from \\nrepatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\\n• sanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions, changes \\nin regimes, or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which may affect our \\nbusiness continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services, limit our ability to source \\ncomponents or final products, or prevent or impede us from operating in certain jurisdictions, complying with local laws, \\nor offering products or services;\\n• longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\\n• an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to litigation, new \\nregulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes, and \\nother liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;\\n• anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to \\ngovernment officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and\\n• different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and differing labor practices, and other \\nchallenges caused by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity of doing \\nbusiness in multiple jurisdictions.\\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we have \\nfaced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion \\nof our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign \\ncurrencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also \\ninherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nWe are\\texposed\\tto\\tfluctuations\\tin\\tthe\\tfair\\tvalues\\tof\\tour investments and,\\tin\\tsome\\tinstances,\\tour\\tfinancial\\t\\nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies.\\nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, \\nnegatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, \\nforeign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new \\nbenchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors. \\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-based \\ncompensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business \\ncombination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and \\nestimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which increases the volatility \\nof our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value remeasurements in any particular \\nperiod may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments. \\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\n12 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVRisks\\tRelated\\tto\\tour Industry\\t\\nPeople\\taccess\\tour\\tproducts\\tand services\\tthrough\\ta\\tvariety\\tof\\tplatformsand\\tdevices\\tthat\\tcontinue\\tto\\nevolve\\twith\\tthe\\tadvancement\\tof\\ttechnology\\tand\\tuser\\tpreferences.\\tIf\\tmanufacturers\\tand\\tusers\\tdo\\tnot\\t\\nwidely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could\\nbe\\xa0harmed.\\nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones, \\nsmartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables (including virtual reality \\nand augmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less \\npopular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, \\nand our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our \\nadvertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. \\nIn addition, search queries may be undertaken via voice-activated search, apps, social media or other platforms, which \\ncould harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and \\ndeveloping competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and \\nsupporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number \\nof new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies \\nthat work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability \\nto capture future business opportunities. \\nIssues\\tin\\tthe\\tdevelopment and\\tuse\\tof\\tAI\\tmay\\tresult\\tin\\treputational harm\\tand\\tincreased\\tliability exposure.\\nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, intellectual \\nproperty infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues. As a result of these \\nand other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to \\ncompetitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under new and proposed legislation and regulations), new \\napplications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. \\nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement AI responsibly \\nand minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant resources to \\ndevelop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-related issues, \\ndeficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our AI tools and \\nsystems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may result in claims, \\nlawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our business, financial \\ncondition, and operating results.\\nData privacy and security concerns\\trelating\\tto\\tour\\ttechnology\\tandour\\tpractices could harm\\tour\\t\\nreputation,\\tcause\\tus\\tto\\tincur\\tsignificant\\tliability,\\tand\\tdetercurrent\\tand\\tpotential\\tusersor customers from\\t\\nusing our\\tproducts\\tand\\tservices.

Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations \\nregarding privacy and data change. \\nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information. \\nSoftware bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches expose us to a \\nrisk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities, \\nincluding regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products incorporate highly \\ntechnical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the future to \\ncontain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features involving AI to our offerings and \\ninternal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our and the market’s \\nunderstanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to develop. We have in the past discovered, \\nand may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the code. Systems and \\n13Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVcontrol failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data \\ncould result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to \\nattract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale \\nand nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, \\nwe expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, \\nmisuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches. \\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. Cyber \\nattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. \\nWe have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect our or other \\nparties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to address \\nundesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we face the risk of cyber \\nattacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public \\nsector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the \\nongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks. \\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or \\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the time \\nthey occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant \\nlegal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative \\npublicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date \\nin the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the techniques \\nused to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change \\nfrequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all reasonable precautions, \\nincluding those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect \\nattacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. \\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-security \\npractices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our users’ \\ndata may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners’ or \\nservice providers’ security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would be harmed, \\nwe could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised, and we may \\nbe exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-action litigation) and \\nregulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business, reputation, financial \\ncondition, and operating results. \\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated \\nworldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, \\nmay not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prevent or limit \\nharm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial \\nexposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘Risks Related to Laws, \\nRegulations, and Policies’ below.\\nOur\\tongoing\\tinvestments\\tin\\tsafety,\\tsecurity,\\tand\\tcontent\\treview\\twill\\tlikelycontinue\\tto\\tidentify\\tabuse\\tof\\tour\\t\\nplatforms and\\tmisuse\\tof\\tuser\\tdata.\\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, \\nand review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, including \\ninvestigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As a result \\nof these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary access to or \\nmisuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered, and may in the \\nfuture not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including our lack of visibility \\nover our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors outside of our control \\nsuch as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third parties. Such incidents \\nand activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or \\npolicies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad purchases, activities that \\n14 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVthreaten people’s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading disinformation. While we may \\nnot determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may remedy them quickly, there \\nis no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including \\ngovernment inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series \\nof related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material \\nindividually at the time of their occurrence. \\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents. \\nAny of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, \\nrequire us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely affect our business \\nand financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which \\ncould result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory \\noversight. \\nProblematic content on\\tour platforms,\\tincluding\\tlow-quality\\tuser-generatedcontent, web\\tspam,\\tcontent\\t\\nfarms,\\tand\\tother\\tviolations of our guidelines\\tcould affect\\tthe\\tquality\\tof\\tour\\tservices,\\twhich\\tcould\\tharm\\tour\\t\\nreputation\\tand\\tdeter\\tour\\tcurrentand potential\\tusers\\tfrom\\tusing\\tour\\tproducts\\tand\\tservices.\\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated \\nattempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to \\notherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to \\npromote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we have been \\nunable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content. \\nIncreased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of abuse for bad actors.\\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search \\nresults than our search engine’s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have affected, and \\nmay continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, or undesirable \\ncontent. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other \\nlanguages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. Although \\nwe continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms, there is no \\nguarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may have negative experiences on our platforms \\nif our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users’ decisions in continuing to use our platforms. We \\nalso face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites \\nthat generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually \\nlaunching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from low-quality websites, but we may not always \\nbe successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including violations of our content guidelines involving \\nincidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users on- or \\noff-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation. \\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality content, it \\ncould hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition \\nand operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties \\nand damages and divert management’s time and attention. \\nOur\\tbusiness depends\\ton\\tcontinued\\tand\\tunimpeded\\taccess to\\tthe\\tInternet by\\tus\\tand\\tour\\tusers.

Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market \\npower in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, \\nmobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or \\nhave stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of \\nour products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging \\nincreased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors preferential access. Some \\njurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers; however, \\nsubstantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, in 2018 the U.S. Federal \\n15Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVCommunications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit internet access providers to restrict, block, \\ndegrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and \\nservices have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, \\nincluding with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or content providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm \\nour reputation; and increase costs, thereby negatively affecting our business. \\nRisks\\tRelated\\tto\\tLaws, Regulations,\\tand\\tPolicies\\t\\nWe are subject\\tto a\\tvariety of new, existing,\\tand\\tchanging laws\\tand\\tregulations worldwide\\tthat\\tcould\\tharm\\t\\nour\\tbusiness, and\\twill\\tlikely\\tbe\\tsubject to an\\teven\\tbroader scope\\tof\\tlaws\\tand\\tregulations as\\twe\\tcontinue to\\t\\nexpand\\tour\\tbusiness.\\t\\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our introduction \\nof new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations. \\nIn recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations \\nrelevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, environmental, social \\nand governance (ESG) requirements, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are \\nlikely to increase in the future. \\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner \\ninconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and services, altered \\nbusiness practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services, substantial \\ncosts, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: \\n• Competition and\\ttechnology platforms’ business\\tpractices: Laws and regulations focused on large technology \\nplatforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal settlements in the U.S., \\nSouth Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play’s billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as litigation and \\nnew regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions.\\n• AI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital products \\nand services, which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example, while legislative text \\nhas yet to be finalized and formally approved, provisional political agreement on a proposed EU AI Act was reached \\nbetween co-legislators in December 2023, including that specific transparency and other requirements would be \\nintroduced for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are based. In addition, the White \\nHouse’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence devises \\na framework for the U.S. government, among other things, to regulate private sector use and development of certain \\nfoundation models. \\n• Data privacy,\\tcollection,and\\tprocessing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, and/or \\nsharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the processing of \\nchildren’s data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data transfers (including \\ndata localization laws). \\n• Copyright\\tand\\tother\\tintellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on Copyright in \\nthe Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new licensing regimes, \\nincrease liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, or create property \\nrights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers, which may result in other \\nregulatory actions. \\n• Content\\tmoderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, \\nsuch as the EU’s Digital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and laws and proposed \\nlegislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain \\ntypes of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms, which \\nmay make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with low-quality, deceptive, or \\nharmful content.\\n• Consumer\\tprotection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could result in \\nmonetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\\n16 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts, regulators, or \\nadministrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on \\nstatutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications \\nDecency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, \\nranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely \\naffect us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the \\nU.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms. \\nOur development, use, and commercialization of AI products and services (including our implementation of AI in our \\nofferings and internal systems) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability, including under specific legislation \\nregulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity, privacy, intellectual property, and \\nother\\xa0laws.\\nWe are\\tand\\tmay\\tcontinue\\tto\\tbe\\tsubject\\tto\\tclaims,\\tlawsuits,\\tregulatory\\tand\\tgovernment\\tinvestigations,\\t\\nenforcementactions,\\tconsent\\torders,\\tand\\tother\\tforms\\tof\\tregulatory\\tscrutiny\\tand\\tlegal\\tliability\\tthat\\tcould\\t\\nharm\\tour\\tbusiness,\\treputation,\\tfinancial\\tcondition, and\\toperating\\tresults.\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and orders involving \\ncompetition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, \\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using \\nour platforms, personal injury, and other matters. We are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, \\nproduct liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also \\nbe subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, AI training, \\ndevelopment, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect \\nwill continue to be brought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and trademark \\ninfringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based \\non the nature and content of information available on or via our services, the design and effect of our products and \\nservices, or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created \\nby third parties. \\nFor example, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated \\nantitrust laws related to Google Play’s billing practices. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024 and the range \\nof potential remedies vary widely. We plan to appeal. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, various U.S. states, \\nand other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising \\ntechnologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the \\nAndroid operating system and Play Store. Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition \\nenforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge \\nour business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and \\ndefending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate. \\nVarious laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past, and may in \\nthe future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to \\nour products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including divestiture, and collateral related \\ncivil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \\noperating results. \\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and \\nother harms to our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and speculative \\nprocess that requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or exceed our \\nestimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional \\nsubstantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, \\nand operating results. \\nFor additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal Proceedings in \\nPart I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n17Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVPrivacy, data\\tprotection, and\\tdata\\tusage\\tregulations are\\tcomplex\\tand\\trapidly\\tevolving\\tareas.\\tAny\\tfailure\\nor\\talleged\\tfailure\\tto comply\\twith\\tthese laws\\tcould\\tharm\\tour\\tbusiness,\\treputation,financial\\tcondition,\\tand\\noperating\\tresults.\\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals \\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation have \\nresulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have had and \\ncould continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, financial condition, \\nand operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and compliance obligations \\ncould cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in ways that harm \\nour business. Examples of these laws include: \\n• The General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which apply to all \\nof our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or related to products \\nand services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or the monitoring of their \\nbehavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\\n• Various comprehensive U.S. state and foreign privacy laws, which give new data privacy rights to their respective \\nresidents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to \\nimplement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant obligations on controllers \\nand processors of consumer data.\\n• State laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act and \\nthe Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that collect or disclose \\nconsumer biometric information. \\n• Various federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to children \\nand minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor’s data. These include the Children’s Online \\nPrivacy Protection Act of 1998, and the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, all of which address the use and \\ndisclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on online services or products directed to \\nor likely to be accessed by children. \\n• The California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with \\ninternet-connected devices.\\n• The EU’s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data across \\ncertain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among other changes. \\nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can \\ntransfer, process and/or receive personal data, as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory authorities related \\nto cross-border transfers of personal data. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we currently rely upon remains \\nsubject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., which may require us to adapt our \\nexisting arrangements.\\nWe face,\\tand\\tmay continue\\tto face,\\tintellectual property and\\tother\\tclaims that\\tcould\\tbe\\tcostly to\\tdefend,\\t\\nresult\\tin\\tsignificant\\tdamage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability\\nto\\tuse\\tcertain technologies.\\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of \\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and trademarks. \\nParties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. \\nInternational Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-holding companies \\nmay frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we continue to \\nexpand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as \\nwe develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies. \\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements \\n(if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or elsewhere, \\nincluding by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain jurisdictions. \\nThey may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for us and \\notherwise harm our business. \\n18 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain \\nintellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement \\nclaims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there \\nwere an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, \\nservices, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and harm our \\nbusiness. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all \\ndamages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, \\nin connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain \\npotential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual \\nproperty claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they \\ncould harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, and operating results. \\nExpectations\\trelating\\tto\\tESG\\tconsiderations\\tcould\\texpose\\tus\\tto\\tpotential\\tliabilities,\\tincreasedcosts,\\tand\\nreputational\\tharm.\\t\\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those related to \\nmatters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords \\nrelating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and \\nformalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven frameworks and/or disclosure \\nrequirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced \\na number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments, \\nand our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in certain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/\\nor performance, are complex and ambitious, and may change. We cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be \\nfully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results \\nwe anticipate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing \\ninterpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could \\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe could be subject to\\tchanges\\tin\\ttax\\trates,\\tthe\\tadoption\\tof\\tnew\\tU.S. or\\tinternational tax\\tlegislation,\\tor\\t\\nexposure to\\tadditional\\ttax\\tliabilities.\\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective \\ntax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory \\ntax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, \\nchanges in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax \\nassets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting \\nprinciples (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf \\nof customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are levied against \\nthird parties. \\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and \\nmay in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing \\nadjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial \\ncondition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject us to additional litigation \\nand regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities \\nrequires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the \\nultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results \\nin the period or periods for which such determination is made. \\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may \\nbe subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For example, \\nvarious jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services \\ntaxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. \\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among more than \\n140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the \\nimplementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase \\nin future years as a result of these changes.\\n19Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVRisks\\tRelated\\tto\\tOwnership\\tof\\tour\\tStock\\nWe cannot\\tguarantee\\tthat\\tany\\tshare\\trepurchase\\tprogram\\twill\\tbe\\tfully\\tconsummated\\tor\\twill\\tenhance\\t\\nlong-term\\tstockholder\\tvalue,\\tand\\tsharerepurchases\\tcould\\tincrease\\tthe\\tvolatility\\tof\\tour\\tstock\\tpricesand\\ncould\\tdiminish\\tour cash reserves.\\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations \\nfrom the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not \\nobligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further, our \\nshare repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be \\nsuspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. \\nThe\\tconcentration\\tof\\tour\\tstock\\townership\\tlimits\\tour\\tstockholders’\\tability\\tto\\tinfluence\\tcorporatematters.\\t\\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no voting rights. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 86.5% of our outstanding Class B \\nstock, which represented approximately 51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock \\nownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election \\nof directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the \\nforeseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the \\nissuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive \\nprograms, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to \\ndetermine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to \\nour repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely \\nrestricts other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do \\nnot view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. \\nProvisions\\tin\\tour\\tcharter\\tdocuments\\tand\\tunder\\tDelaware\\tlaw\\tcould\\tdiscourage\\ta\\ttakeover\\tthat\\t\\nstockholders\\tmay\\tconsiderfavorable.\\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of \\ncontrol or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: \\n• Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors \\nor the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\\n• Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a \\nstockholders’ meeting.\\n• Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority \\nstockholders to elect director candidates.\\n• Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose \\nmatters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential \\nacquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting \\nto obtain control of our company. \\n• Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it \\npossible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede \\nthe success of any attempt to acquire us. \\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a \\ncorporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock \\nunless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the \\ntransaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. \\nThe\\ttrading\\tprice for\\tour\\tClass A\\tstock\\tand\\tnon-voting Class C\\tstock\\tmay\\tcontinue to be\\tvolatile.\\t\\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In addition \\nto the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have fluctuated, and may \\ncontinue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others, \\nthe activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world. These broad market \\nand industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual \\noperating performance. \\n20 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVGeneral\\tRisks\\t\\nOur\\toperating results\\tmay fluctuate,\\twhich\\tmakes\\tour\\tresults\\tdifficult\\tto\\tpredict\\tand\\tcould\\tcause\\tour\\nresults\\tto\\tfall\\tshort\\tof\\texpectations.\\t\\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many outside of \\nour control, including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, comparing \\nour operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis may not be \\nmeaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. Consequently, our \\noperating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. \\nAcquisitions,\\tjoint ventures,\\tinvestments,\\tand\\tdivestitures\\tcould\\tresult\\tin\\toperating\\tdifficulties,\\ndilution, and\\tother\\tconsequences\\tthat\\tcould harm\\tour\\tbusiness, financial condition, and operating\\nresults.\\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy \\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. \\nWe expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic \\narrangements, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we \\nface risks include: \\n• diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other \\nstrategic arrangements; \\n• failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon \\napproval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our \\nability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\\n• failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including cultural \\nintegration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology; \\n• implementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired \\ncompany; \\n• integration of the acquired company’s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of product, \\nengineering, and sales and marketing functions;\\n• transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\\n• in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to \\naddress the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; \\n• failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures, and other \\nstrategic arrangements;\\n• failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\\n• liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement \\nclaims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, warranty claims, product \\nliabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\\n• litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, \\ncustomers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and \\nother strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and \\nharm our business generally. \\nOur acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the \\nincurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived \\nassets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Also, the \\nanticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements may not materialize. In connection with \\nour divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, \\nwhich could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\n21Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVWe rely\\ton\\thighly\\tskilled\\tpersonnel\\tand,\\tif\\twe\\tare\\tunable\\tto\\tretain\\tor\\tmotivate\\tkey\\tpersonnel,\\thire\\tqualified\\npersonnel,\\tor\\tmaintain\\tand\\tcontinue\\tto\\tadapt\\tour\\tcorporate\\tculture,we\\tmay\\tnot\\tbe\\table\\tto\\tgrow\\tor\\t\\noperate\\xa0effectively.\\nOur performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as well as \\nmembers of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet \\nand its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our culture, and setting \\nour strategic direction. \\nOur ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, \\nand retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees \\nis intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our employees. In addition, \\nour compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new \\nemployees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may \\nalso affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. All of our executive officers and key employees \\nare at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies.\\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows \\nand evolves, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such \\nas during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or \\nhave an adverse effect on our corporate culture. Under our hybrid work models, we may experience increased costs and/or \\ndisruption, in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture. \\nItem\\t1B.\\t Unresolved\\tStaff Comments\\nNot applicable.\\nItem\\t1C.\\t Cybersecurity\\nWe maintain a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats \\nas part of our broader risk management system and processes.

Teams of dedicated privacy, safety, and security professionals oversee cybersecurity risk management and mitigation, \\nincident prevention, detection, and remediation. Leadership for these teams are professionals with deep cybersecurity \\nexpertise across multiple industries, including our Vice President of Privacy, Safety, and Security Engineering. Our executive \\nleadership team, along with input from the above teams, are responsible for our overall enterprise risk management system \\nand processes and regularly consider cybersecurity risks in the context of other material risks to the company.\\nAs part of our cybersecurity risk management system, our incident management teams track and log privacy and security \\nincidents across Alphabet, our vendors, and other third-party service providers to remediate and resolve any such \\nincidents. Significant incidents are reviewed regularly by a cross-functional working group to determine whether further \\nescalation is appropriate. Any incident assessed as potentially being or potentially becoming material is immediately \\nescalated for further assessment, and then reported to designated members of our senior management. We consult with \\noutside counsel as appropriate, including on materiality analysis and disclosure matters, and our senior management makes \\nthe final materiality determinations and disclosure and other compliance decisions. Our management apprises Alphabet’s \\nindependent public accounting firm of matters and any relevant developments.\\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity threats, \\nincluding compliance with disclosure requirements, cooperation with law enforcement, and related effects on financial and other \\nrisks, and it reports any findings and recommendations, as appropriate, to the full Board for consideration. Senior management \\nregularly discusses cyber risks and trends and, should they arise, any material incidents with the Audit and Compliance \\nCommittee. Internal Audit maintains a dedicated cybersecurity auditing team that independently tests our cybersecurity controls. \\nOur business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from \\ncybersecurity threats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide \\nassurance that they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents.

Discussion of 2022 results compared to \\n2021 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s\\tFinancial\\tResults\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google \\nServices and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For additional information \\non our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTrends\\tin\\tOur\\tBusiness\\tand\\tFinancial\\tEffect\\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they \\nwill continue to affect our future results:\\n• Users’\\tbehaviors\\tand\\tadvertising\\tcontinue\\tto\\tshift\\tonline\\tas\\tthe\\tdigital\\teconomyevolves.\\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since \\ninception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower \\npace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect \\nour revenues.\\n• Users\\tcontinue\\tto\\taccess our\\tproducts\\tand\\tservices\\tusing\\tdiverse\\tdevices\\tand\\tmodalities, which\\tallows\\tfor\\tnew\\t\\nadvertising\\tformats\\tthat\\tmay\\tbenefit\\tour\\trevenues\\tbut\\tadversely\\taffect\\tour\\tmargins.\\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, \\nconnected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are \\ndoing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and \\ngrow our business.\\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. \\nThe margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop \\nsearch. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be \\naffected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market saturation in \\ndeveloped countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC \\nas a percentage of our advertising revenues (“TAC rate”) to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner \\nagreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative \\nrevenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\\n•As\\tonline advertising\\tevolves, we\\tcontinue\\tto expand\\tour\\tproduct\\tofferings,\\twhich\\tmay\\taffectour monetization.\\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand \\nour product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, revenues from \\nads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also expect to continue \\nto incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends. When \\ndeveloping new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization.\\n26 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IV• As\\tusers\\tin\\tdeveloping\\teconomies\\tincreasingly\\tcome\\tonline,our\\trevenues from\\tinternationalmarkets\\tcontinue\\t\\nto\\tincrease,\\tand\\tmay\\trequire\\tcontinued\\tinvestments.\\tIn\\taddition,\\tmovementsin foreign\\texchange\\trates\\taffect\\nsuch\\trevenues.\\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including \\nin emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and \\nadvertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from emerging \\nmarkets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as \\nlow-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially \\nmonetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency \\nexchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce \\nour exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\\n• The\\trevenues\\tthat\\twe\\tderive\\tbeyond\\tadvertising\\tare\\tincreasing\\tand\\tmay\\tadverselyaffect\\tour\\tmargins.\\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics than our \\nadvertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products \\nand services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising \\nrevenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and \\nhigher cost of sales.\\n• As\\twe\\tcontinue\\tto\\tserve\\tour\\tusers and\\texpand\\tour businesses,\\twe will invest heavily\\tin\\toperating and\\tcapital\\t\\nexpenditures.\\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop \\nnew, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesses. \\nWe also expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network \\nequipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support \\nof AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our \\nofferings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic \\ninitiatives.\\n• We\\tcontinue\\tto\\tface an\\tevolving regulatory environment, and we\\tare subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and\\t\\nother\\tforms\\tof\\tpotential\\tlegal\\tliability,\\twhich\\tcould\\taffect\\tourbusiness\\tpractices and financial\\tresults.\\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of \\ntopics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in fines and caused \\nus to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability \\nto pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our \\nbusiness practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by \\nthe U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; legislative proposals and pending litigation in the \\nU.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms; \\nand the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various legislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large \\ntechnology platforms. For additional information, see Item 1A Risk Factors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n• Our\\temployees\\tare\\tcritical\\tto\\toursuccess\\tand\\twe\\texpect\\tto\\tcontinue\\tinvesting\\tin\\tthem.\\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented \\nemployees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information, see Culture \\nand Workforce in Part I, Item 1 Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n27Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVRevenues\\tand\\tMonetization\\tMetrics\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and devices; and fees received for \\nconsumer subscription-based products. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes \\nto Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above, fluctuations in our revenues \\nhave been, and may continue to be, affected by a combination of general factors, including:\\n• changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n• changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\\n• general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other \\nmeasures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \\n• new product and service launches; and\\n• seasonality.\\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (“Google advertising”), revenues from other sources \\n(“Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues”), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been, and may \\ncontinue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.\\nGoogle\\tServices\\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues.\\nGoogle\\tAdvertising\\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \\n• Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic \\ngenerated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and \\nother Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n• YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\\n• Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, \\nand Google Ad Manager.\\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising \\nrevenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and \\ncost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.\\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties \\nand other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is \\ndefined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge \\nadvertisers for each engagement by users.\\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, \\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided \\nby our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression \\ndisplayed to users. \\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and \\ncounting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the \\ncorresponding click and impression activity.\\n28 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other \\nproperties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation \\nbetween these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described \\nabove, such as:\\n• advertiser competition for keywords;\\n• changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\\n• changes in device mix; \\n• seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional \\nretail seasonality; and\\n• traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.\\nGoogle\\tSubscriptions,\\tPlatforms,\\tand\\tDevices\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:\\n• consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube Music and \\nPremium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n• platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n• devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\\n• other products and services.\\nFluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by \\nfactors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of \\nsubscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.\\nGoogle Cloud\\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\\n• Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, and \\nother services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, analytics, and AI offerings \\nincluding our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\\n• Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, \\nsuch as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google Workspace; and\\n• other enterprise services.\\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the \\ngeneral factors described above, such as customer usage.\\nOther\\tBets\\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\\nCosts and Expenses\\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs \\nrelated to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including \\nthose associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are \\ngenerally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in compensation \\nexpenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in particular due to annual stock-based compensation \\n(SBC) awards that generally vest over four years. \\n29Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVCost of\\tRevenues\\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n• TAC includes: \\n• amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution \\npartners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and\\n• amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n• Other cost of revenues primarily includes:\\n• compensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and customer and \\nproduct support;\\n• content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for \\ndistribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a \\nflat fee);\\n• depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\\n• inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than \\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the \\nadvertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\\nOperating\\tExpenses\\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales \\nand marketing, or general and administrative.\\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\\n• compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new \\nproducts and services; \\n• depreciation; and\\n• third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and \\nproduct development efforts.\\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\\n• compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service \\nfunctions; and\\n• spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\\n• compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other \\nadministrative support functions; \\n• expenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and \\n• third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.\\nOther\\tIncome\\t(Expense),\\tNet\\nOI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net \\ngains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and \\nimpairment from our equity method investments. \\nFor additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value \\nof our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 as \\nwell as Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n30 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVProvision for\\tIncome Taxes\\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. \\nand the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to \\nreserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.\\nFor additional information, including a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate, see Note 14 \\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nExecutive Overview\\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results (in millions, except for per share information and \\npercentages):\\nYear\\tEnded\\tDecember\\t31,\\n2022 2023 $ Change % Change\\nConsolidated revenues $ 282,836 $ 307,394 $ 24,558 9%\\nChange in consolidated constant currency revenues(1) 10%\\nCost of revenues $ 126,203 $ 133,332 $ 7,129 6%\\nOperating expenses $ 81,791 $ 89,769 $ 7,978 10%\\nOperating income $ 74,842 $ 84,293 $ 9,451 13%\\nOperating margin 26% 27% 1%\\nOther income (expense), net $ (3,514) $ 1,424 $ 4,938 NM\\nNet income $ 59,972 $ 73,795 $ 13,823 23%\\nDiluted EPS $ 4.56 $ 5.80 $ 1.24 27%\\nNM = Not Meaningful\\n(1) See “Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information” below for details relating to our use of constant currency information. \\n• Revenues were $307.4 billion, an increase of 9% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services \\nrevenues of $19.0 billion, or 8%, and an increase in Google Cloud revenues of $6.8 billion, or 26%. \\n• Total constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 10% year over year.\\n• Cost of revenues was $133.3 billion, an increase of 6% year over year, primarily driven by increases in content acquisition \\ncosts, compensation expenses, and TAC. The increase in compensation expenses included charges related to employee \\nseverance associated with the reduction in our workforce. Additionally, cost of revenues benefited from a reduction in \\ndepreciation due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment.\\n• Operating expenses were $89.8 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in \\ncompensation expenses and charges related to our office space optimization efforts. The increase in compensation \\nexpenses was largely the result of charges related to employee severance associated with the reduction in our workforce \\nand an increase in SBC expense. Operating expenses benefited from the change in the estimated useful lives of our \\nservers and certain network equipment.\\nOther\\tInformation:\\n• In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result we recorded employee severance and \\nrelated charges of $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our \\nglobal office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023, were $1.8 billion. \\nIn addition to these exit charges, for the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $269\\xa0million in accelerated rent \\nand accelerated depreciation.

The effect of this change \\nwas a reduction in depreciation expense of $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, recognized primarily \\nin cost of revenues and R&D expenses. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n• On July 21, 2023, the IRS announced a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior \\nto 2022 related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits. This announcement applies to foreign taxes paid or accrued in the \\nfiscal years 2022 and 2023. A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to the prior period for this tax rule change was \\nrecorded in 2023 and is reflected in our effective tax rate of 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023.\\n• Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $62.2 billion for the year ended December\\xa031, 2023. For additional \\ninformation, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on \\nForm 10-K.\\n• Operating cash flow was $101.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.\\n• Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $32.3 billion for the year \\nended December 31, 2023.\\n• As of December\\xa031, 2023, we had 182,502 employees.\\nFinancial\\tResults\\nRevenues\\nThe following table presents revenues by type (in millions):\\nYear\\tEnded\\tDecember\\t31,\\n2022 2023\\nGoogle Search & other $ 162,450 $ 175,033\\nYouTube ads 29,243 31,510\\nGoogle Network 32,780 31,312\\nGoogle advertising 224,473 237,855\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices 29,055 34,688\\nGoogle Services total 253,528 272,543\\nGoogle Cloud 26,280 33,088\\nOther Bets 1,068 1,527\\nHedging gains (losses) 1,960 236\\nTotal revenues $ 282,836 $ 307,394\\nGoogle\\tServices\\nGoogle\\tadvertising\\trevenues\\nGoogle\\tSearch & other\\nGoogle Search & other revenues increased $12.6 billion from 2022 to 2023.

The growth in device revenues was primarily \\ndriven by increased sales of Pixel devices. The decrease in platform revenues was primarily due to Google Play, driven by \\nthe fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase \\nin Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates.\\nGoogle Cloud\\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased $6.8 billion from 2022 to 2023. Growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud Platform \\nfollowed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud’s infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of \\ngrowth in Google Cloud Platform.\\nRevenues by Geography\\nThe following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the addresses of \\nour customers:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2023\\nUnited States 48% 47%\\nEMEA 29% 30%\\nAPAC 16% 17%\\nOther Americas 6% 6%\\nHedging gains (losses) 1% 0%\\nFor additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual \\nReport on Form 10-K.\\n33Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVUse of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information\\nInternational revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple \\ncurrencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\\nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period \\ncomparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage \\nchange in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”) for financial and operational \\ndecision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a \\nconstant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the \\nability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative \\nof our core operating results.\\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period \\nover period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate \\nmovements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant \\ncurrency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant \\ncurrency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange \\nrates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over \\nprior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year \\ncomparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. \\nResults on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by \\nother companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in millions, \\nexcept percentages):\\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\n% Change from Prior Period\\nYear Ended December 31, As\\nReported\\nLess\\nHedging\\nEffect\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues2022 2023\\nUnited States $ 134,814 $ 146,286 $ 0 $ 146,286 9% 0% 9%\\nEMEA 82,062 91,038 460 90,578 11% 1% 10%\\nAPAC 47,024 51,514  (1,759) 53,273 10% (3)% 13%\\nOther Americas 16,976 18,320  (654) 18,974 8% (4)% 12%\\nRevenues, excluding \\nhedging effect\\n280,876 307,158  (1,953) 309,111 9% (1)% 10%\\nHedging gains (losses) 1,960 236\\nTotal revenues(1) $ 282,836 $ 307,394 $ 309,111 9% 0% (1)% 10%\\n(1) Total constant currency revenues of $309.1 billion for 2023 increased $28.2 billion compared to $280.9 billion in revenues, excluding \\nhedging effect, for 2022.\\nEMEA revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the \\nU.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira.\\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the \\nU.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to \\nthe U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\\n34 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVCosts and Expenses\\nCost of Revenues\\nThe following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2022 2023\\nTAC $ 45,566 $ 48,955 $ 50,886\\nOther cost of revenues 65,373 77,248 82,446\\nTotal cost of revenues $ 110,939 $ 126,203 $ 133,332\\nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 43% 45% 43%\\nCost of revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2022 to 2023 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of \\n$5.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.\\nThe increase in TAC from 2022 to 2023 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven \\nby growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.8% to 21.4% from 2022 to 2023 primarily due to a \\nrevenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & \\nother revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from 2022 to 2023.\\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, \\nlargely for YouTube, and compensation expenses, which included $479 million of charges related to employee severance \\nassociated with the reduction in our workforce. Additionally, other cost of revenues benefited from a reduction in \\ndepreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment.\\nThe increase in other cost of revenues of $11.9 billion from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to increases in device costs, \\ncompensation expenses, depreciation, and equipment-related expenses.\\nResearch and Development\\nThe following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2023\\nResearch and development expenses $ 39,500 $ 45,427\\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 14% 15%\\nR&D expenses increased $5.9 billion from 2022 to 2023 primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of \\n$2.9 billion, $870 million in charges related to our office space optimization efforts, and an increase in depreciation \\nexpense of $722 million. The $2.9 billion increase in compensation expenses was largely the result of a 4% increase in \\naverage headcount, after adjusting for roles affected by the reduction in our workforce, and an increase in SBC expense. \\nAdditionally, the increase in compensation expenses included $848 million in employee severance charges associated with \\nthe reduction in our workforce.

While various countries have implemented the legislation as of January 1, 2024, we do not expect a resulting material \\nchange to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As additional jurisdictions enact such legislation, we expect our \\neffective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years. \\nFinancial Condition\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $110.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash \\nequivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government \\nbonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities.\\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we \\ngenerate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business.

In Google Services, we also generate cash through \\nconsumer subscriptions and the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices. In Google Cloud we generate \\ncash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools, and other \\ncloud services.\\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, to \\nemployees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to \\nsuppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to the increase in cash received from \\ncustomers, partially offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses.\\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable \\nsecurities.

Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments \\nrelated to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to an increase in repurchases of stock.\\n38 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing \\nactivities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing \\nactivities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through \\npurchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and \\nproducts.\\nCapital Expenditures\\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\\n• technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, \\nand networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as our information \\ntechnology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\\n• office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as “fit-outs”).\\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed \\nin service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to \\nyears. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we \\nacquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets.\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we spent $31.5 billion and $32.3 billion on capital expenditures, \\nrespectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including \\nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in \\nparticular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the \\ndeployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the years \\nended December 31, 2022 and 2023, our depreciation on property and equipment were $13.5 billion and $11.9 billion, \\nrespectively.  \\nLeases \\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we recognized total operating lease assets of $4.4 billion and \\n$2.9 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which \\nhad a weighted average remaining lease term of eight years, was $17.7 billion, of which $3.2 billion is short-term. As of \\nDecember 31, 2023, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-term lease \\npayments of $657 million and $3.3 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will \\ncommence between 2024 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years. \\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were \\n$3.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.

On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine \\nfrom €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice.\\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our \\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For additional information, \\nsee Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTaxes\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had income taxes payable of $4.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion was short-term, related to a \\none-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). As permitted by the Tax \\nAct, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have long-term taxes payable \\nof $6.3 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2023.\\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $45.9 billion, of \\nwhich $31.6 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure \\nas well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to \\npurchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, \\nwe do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, \\n2023. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of \\norder fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 10 of the Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n40 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy \\nattributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. \\nThe amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not \\nreadily determinable.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates \\nand assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at \\nthe time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our \\nfinancial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base \\nour estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and \\nwe evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and \\nCompliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our \\nnon-marketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method \\n(“the measurement alternative”) and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward \\nadjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These \\nadjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of \\nunobservable inputs. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date \\nand involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or \\nother available market data.\\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies’ \\nfinancial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of impairment exist, we \\nprepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income \\napproach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee revenues and \\ncosts, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When the quantitative remeasurements \\nof fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.\\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. \\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of \\nunobservable inputs.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other \\nchanges occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization \\nof assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from \\nthe assets. \\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our \\nuncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable \\nand resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions \\nperiodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well \\nas the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain \\ntax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To the extent that \\nthe final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for \\nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\\n41Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net \\ninterest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and \\nother tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes \\nresulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and \\nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, data security, tax and related compliance, labor \\nand employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers \\nor publishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters \\ninclude speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe \\nthat it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a \\nloss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of \\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been \\npreviously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes \\nto our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss \\nrelated to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount \\nrecorded, and such amounts could be material.\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment resulting in a \\nchange in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years. This change in accounting \\nestimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About \\nMarket Risk\\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity \\ninvestment risks. \\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated \\nin foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. \\nAs discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged \\nincluded the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign \\ncurrency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was \\nreasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced.\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts \\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. \\nThe foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are offset by the gains \\nand losses on the forward and option contracts.\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and \\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would \\nhave resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $136 million and $503 million as of \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the \\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\n42 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination \\nof purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency \\nexchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the \\nforeign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency forward and \\noption contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not \\nentirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow \\nhedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of \\naccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged \\nexposures as they occur. \\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our cash \\nflow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion lower as of December 31, 2022 and \\n2023, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency \\nchange in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk \\nfrom our foreign operations.\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI related \\nto our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $903 million and $946 million lower \\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a \\ncorresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain \\nliquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed \\nand asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives. By policy, we \\nlimit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning \\nsecurities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected \\ndue to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. \\nUnrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared \\nto interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair \\nvalue option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure securities for which we have not elected \\nthe fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected \\ncredit losses. \\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our \\nmarketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our \\ninvestment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% \\nconfidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2022 and \\n2023 are shown below (in millions):\\nAs of December 31,\\n12-Month Average \\nAs of December 31,\\n2022 2023 2022 2023\\nRisk category - interest rate $ 256 $ 296 $ 198 $ 271\\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the \\nsensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting \\nthe timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to \\nrepresent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\\n43Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVEquity Investment Risk\\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could \\nsubstantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are \\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily \\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and \\nrepresent $5.2 billion and $6.0 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. A hypothetical \\nadverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2023 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity \\nsecurities by $597 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our \\nmarketable equity securities.\\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for \\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the \\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an \\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the \\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are \\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which \\ncould result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity investments \\nin private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable \\ntransactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions could result in \\nadditional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood \\nof our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, \\nacquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity securities may \\nnot directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the \\ncarrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, \\nwas $28.5 billion and $28.8 billion, respectively. \\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 \\nand 2023, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments could be impaired if the \\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n44 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVItem\\xa08.\\u2002\\u2002Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\nAlphabet Inc.\\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 42) 46\\nFinancial Statements:\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 49\\nConsolidated Statements of Income 50\\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 51\\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity 52\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 53\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 54\\n45Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet Inc.

In our opinion, \\nthe consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at \\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period \\nended December\\xa031, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \\n(PCAOB), the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2023, based on criteria established in \\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission \\n(2013 framework), and our report dated January\\xa030, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion \\non the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB \\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and \\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan \\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to \\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a \\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements \\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or \\ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex \\njudgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated \\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a \\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. \\n46 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVLoss Contingencies\\nDescription\\nof the Matter\\nThe Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, \\nother proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and \\nsecurity, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated \\nby its users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their platforms, personal \\ninjury, consumer protection, and other matters. As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial \\nstatements “Commitments and contingencies” such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government \\ninvestigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in adverse consequences.\\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood, and the estimated amount, of a loss \\nrelated to such matters.

In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all \\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \\n(PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated January 30, 2024 expressed an \\nunqualified opinion thereon. \\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its \\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s \\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are \\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the \\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \\nmaintained in all material respects. \\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material \\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed \\nrisk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit \\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding \\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies \\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect \\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations \\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \\nfinancial\\xa0statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures \\nmay\\xa0deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 30, 2024\\n48 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVAlphabet Inc.\\nConsolidated Balance

Part II Part III Part IVAlphabet Inc.\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In \\n2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor \\nissuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales \\nof other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the \\nvariable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions \\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results \\ncould differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including \\nthose related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial instruments \\nand goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates \\non assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the \\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the \\nestimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment \\nfrom five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the \\ncarrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during \\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of \\n$3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per diluted share, for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the \\ncollectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes \\nare excluded from revenues. \\nAdvertising Revenues\\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\\n• Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use \\nGoogle.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like \\nGmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n• YouTube properties; and\\n• Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and \\nGoogle Ad Manager.\\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display & \\nVideo 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\\n54 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance \\nadvertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is \\ndisplayed, or a user views the ad.\\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross \\nbasis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google \\nNetwork properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts \\npaid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising \\ninventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising \\ninventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our \\ncustomers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\\n• consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube Music and \\nPremium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n• platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n• devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\\n• other products and services.\\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report revenues \\nfrom Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to facilitate a \\ntransaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. \\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\\n• Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, and \\nother services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, analytics, and AI offerings \\nincluding our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\\n• Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, \\nsuch as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google Workspace; and\\n• other enterprise services.\\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms \\nlonger than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer \\nutilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a \\nsubscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of \\nthe cloud services.\\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues \\nto each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling \\nprices based on the prices charged to customers.\\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We \\nestimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that \\nthere will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\\nSales Commissions\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an \\nasset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are \\nrecorded within sales and marketing expenses.\\n55Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n• TAC includes: \\n• amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution \\npartners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and\\n• amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n• Other cost of revenues includes:\\n• compensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and customer and \\nproduct support;\\n• content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for \\ndistribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);\\n• depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\\n• inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of \\nproducts to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological \\nfeasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the \\ncriteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based \\napplications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the \\npreliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to \\nperform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for \\nthe periods presented.\\nStock-based Compensation \\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified \\nand measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the \\nstraight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us \\non behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax \\nwithholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market \\nconditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and certain awards \\ngranted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain \\nawards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair \\nvalue of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet company.\\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December\\xa031, \\n2021,\\xa02022, and 2023, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $7.9 billion, $9.2 billion, and $8.7 billion, \\nrespectively.\\nPerformance Fees\\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments. \\nWe record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense \\nrecognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable \\ninputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\\n56 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVFair Value Measurements \\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in \\nan orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined \\nbased on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at \\nfair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the \\ninputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical \\nor similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant \\ninputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models \\nproject future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs \\nincluding interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \\ninputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and \\nrelevant inputs into valuation models.\\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable \\nsecurities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at \\nfair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried \\nat cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\\nWe measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain \\nassets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \\nFinancial Instruments\\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative financial \\ninstruments and accounts receivable.\\nCredit Risks\\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial instruments, \\nincluding foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely \\nassessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange \\ncontracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically \\nunsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk \\nexposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We \\ngenerally do not require collateral from our customers.\\nCash Equivalents\\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities, time deposits, and money market funds.\\nMarketable Securities\\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase \\nas cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our \\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities \\nat the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted \\nfor our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as \\nour liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities. As we view these securities \\nas available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current \\nassets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, \\nand report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for the changes in \\n57Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVallowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded in OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected \\nthe fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains or losses \\non the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a \\ncomponent of OI&E.\\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, including \\nunrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up restrictions \\nbeyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nNon-Marketable Securities\\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities \\nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. All \\nother non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. \\nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes \\nresulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. \\nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a \\ncomponent of OI&E.\\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current assets \\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. \\nAccounts Receivable\\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or services \\noffered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and \\ncustomers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Additionally, accounts \\nreceivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer.\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts \\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements \\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics \\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In \\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due \\nstatus and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also \\nconsider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of \\nfuture economic conditions.\\nOther\\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into \\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing \\nthe substance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be \\naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of the \\narrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies becomes \\nimpaired, any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.\\nImpairment of Investments\\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. \\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is estimated by \\nconsidering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current \\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, not to exceed the amount \\nof the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is \\nmore likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized \\ncost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. \\n58 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment indicators \\nexist by evaluating the companies\\' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among other indicators. \\nIf the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by recording \\nthe corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity \\ninvestments using a market approach or an income approach.\\nInventory\\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed \\nusing the first-in, first-out method.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which \\nwe have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary \\nbeneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly \\naffect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If \\nwe are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance \\nwith applicable GAAP.\\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of \\nwhether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, \\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, \\noffices, data centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network \\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet \\nbeen placed in service. \\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line \\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. We depreciate \\nbuildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over a period of six \\nyears for servers and network equipment. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease \\nterm or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold \\nimprovements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use.\\nGoodwill\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our \\nreporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we \\nreassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or \\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were \\nnot material for the periods presented.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease \\ncomponents. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include \\npayments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments \\nand account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and \\nliabilities.\\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease \\nassets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and payments for \\nmaintenance and utilities.\\n59Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement \\ndate. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing \\nrate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is \\nestimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic \\nenvironments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate \\nthe lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, \\nlease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and \\nlease incentives.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our \\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included \\nin operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are \\nincluded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest \\nlevel of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the \\ncarrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the \\ncarrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by \\nwhich the carrying value exceeds its fair value. \\nIncome Taxes\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable \\nor refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that \\nhave been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities \\nbased on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets based on \\nall available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that \\nthey will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that \\nthey will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax Income provision as a \\ncurrent period expense.\\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical \\nmerits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial \\nstatements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon \\nsettlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a \\ncomponent of the income tax provision.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase \\nprice of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for \\nrevenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess of the \\npurchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses \\nare recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates \\nfor assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, \\ncosts, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ equity. We reflect \\nnet foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional \\ncurrency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\\n60 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07 \\n\"Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands annual and interim \\ndisclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment \\nexpenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods beginning \\nJanuary 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard \\nwill have on our financial statement disclosures.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to \\nexpand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. \\nASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently \\nevaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\\nPrior Period Reclassifications\\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\\nNote 2.\\u2002\\u2002Revenues\\nDisaggregated Revenues\\nThe following table presents revenues disaggregated by type (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2022 2023\\nGoogle Search & other $ 148,951 $ 162,450 $ 175,033\\nYouTube ads 28,845 29,243 31,510\\nGoogle Network 31,701 32,780 31,312\\nGoogle advertising 209,497 224,473 237,855\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices 28,032 29,055 34,688\\nGoogle Services total 237,529 253,528 272,543\\nGoogle Cloud 19,206 26,280 33,088\\nOther Bets 753 1,068 1,527\\nHedging gains (losses) 149 1,960 236\\nTotal revenues $ 257,637 $ 282,836 $ 307,394\\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2021, 2022, or 2023. \\nThe following table presents revenues disaggregated by geography, based on the addresses of our customers (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2022 2023\\nUnited States $ 117,854 46 % $ 134,814 48 % $ 146,286 47%\\nEMEA(1) 79,107 31 82,062 29 91,038 30\\nAPAC(1) 46,123 18 47,024 16 51,514 17\\nOther Americas(1) 14,404 5 16,976 6 18,320 6\\nHedging gains (losses) 149 0 1,960 1 236 0\\nTotal revenues $ 257,637 100% $ 282,836 100% $ 307,394 100%\\n(1) Regions represent Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Asia-Pacific (APAC); and Canada and Latin America (\"Other Americas\").\\n61Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVRevenue Backlog\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2023, we had $74.1 billion of remaining performance obligations (“revenue backlog”), primarily related \\nto Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet \\nbeen recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is \\nlargely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. \\nWe expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining \\nto be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that \\nwill be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable \\ncontracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts \\nwhich are refundable.

Financial Instruments \\nFair Value Measurements\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level \\n2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based \\nupon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.\\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted \\nmarket prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to \\ndetermine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair \\nvalue are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and \\nlosses from related derivative contracts.\\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, 2022\\nFair Value \\nHierarchy\\nAdjusted \\nCost\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nGains\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses Fair Value\\nCash and Cash \\nEquivalents\\nMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive income\\nTime deposits Level 2 $\\x08 5,297 $\\x08 0 $\\x08 0 $\\x08 5,297 $\\x08 5,293 $\\x08 4\\nGovernment bonds Level 2 41,036 64 (2,045) 39,055 283 38,772\\nCorporate debt securities Level 2 28,578 8 (1,569) 27,017 1 27,016\\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed securities Level 2 16,176 5 (1,242) 14,939 0 14,939\\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value change \\nreflected in other \\ncomprehensive income(1) $\\x08 91,087 $\\x08 77 $\\x08 (4,856) $\\x08 86,308 $\\x08 5,577 $\\x08 80,731\\nFair value adjustments \\nrecorded in net income\\nMoney market funds Level 1 $\\x08 7,234 $\\x08 7,234 $\\x08 0\\nCurrent marketable equity \\nsecurities(2)\\nLevel 1\\n4,013 0 4,013\\nMutual funds Level 2 339 0 339\\nGovernment bonds Level 2 1,877 440 1,437\\nCorporate debt securities Level 2 3,744 65 3,679\\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed securities\\nLevel 2\\n1,686 2 1,684\\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value change \\nrecorded in net income $\\x08 18,893 $\\x08 7,741 $\\x08 11,152\\nCash 0 8,561 0\\nTotal $\\x08 91,087 $\\x08 77 $\\x08 (4,856) $\\x08 105,201 $\\x08 21,879 $\\x08 91,883\\n(1) Represents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\\n(2) The\\x08long-term\\x08portion\\x08of\\x08marketable\\x08equity\\x08securities\\x08(subject\\x08to\\x08long-term\\x08lock-up\\x08restrictions)\\x08of\\x08$803\\x08million\\x08as\\x08of\\x08December\\x0831,\\xa02022\\nis included within other non-current assets.\\n63Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVAs of December 31, 2023\\nFair Value \\nHierarchy\\nAdjusted \\nCost\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nGains\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses Fair Value\\nCash and \\nCash \\nEquivalents\\nMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive income\\nTime deposits Level 2 $\\x08 2,628 $\\x08 0 $\\x08 0 $\\x08 2,628 $\\x08 2,628 $\\x08 0\\nGovernment bonds Level 2 38,106 233 (679) 37,660 1,993 35,667\\nCorporate debt securities Level 2 22,457 112 (637) 21,932 0 21,932\\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed securities Level 2 17,243 88 (634) 16,697 0 16,697\\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value change \\nreflected in other \\ncomprehensive income(1) $\\x08 80,434 $\\x08 433 $\\x08 (1,950) $\\x08 78,917 $\\x08 4,621 $\\x08 74,296\\nFair value adjustments \\nrecorded in net income\\nMoney market funds Level 1 $\\x08 6,480 $\\x08 6,480 $\\x08 0\\nCurrent marketable equity \\nsecurities(2) Level 1 4,282 0 4,282\\nMutual funds Level 2 311 0 311\\nGovernment bonds Level 2 1,952 347 1,605\\nCorporate debt securities Level 2 3,782 91 3,691\\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed securities\\nLevel 2\\n2,683 0 2,683\\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value change \\nrecorded in net income $\\x08 19,490 $\\x08 6,918 $\\x08 12,572\\nCash 0 12,509 0\\nTotal $\\x08 80,434 $\\x08 433 $\\x08 (1,950) $\\x08 98,407 $\\x08 24,048 $\\x08 86,868\\n(1) Represents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\\n(2) The\\x08long-term\\x08portion\\x08of\\x08marketable\\x08equity\\x08securities\\x08(subject\\x08to\\x08long-term\\x08lock-up\\x08restrictions)\\x08of\\x08$1.4\\x08billion\\x08as\\x08of\\x08December\\xa031,\\x082023\\x08\\nis included within other non-current assets.\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market \\nvalues.

The primary risk managed is \\nforeign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in \\nforeign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative \\ninstruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily \\nwithin Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination \\nof purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting \\ntreatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain \\nforecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of \\n24 months or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently \\nreclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in \\nrevenues.

Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude \\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to \\nour investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness \\nare recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge \\nintercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional \\ncurrency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily \\nrecorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, \\ncredit exposures, and to enhance investment returns.

We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that \\nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as \\nappropriate.\\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial changes to our \\nbusiness practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood \\nof there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the \\nreasonably possible loss or range of losses.

The \\nDOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on \\nOctober 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. The trial \\nended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and \\nConsumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an \\ninvestigation into Search distribution practices.\\n• On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the \\nEastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating \\nto its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along \\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \\nVirginiaalleging that Google’s digital advertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17,2023,\\na number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened \\n77Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVa formal investigation into Google’s advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and \\nJune 29,\\x082022,\\x08respectively.\\x08On\\x08June\\x0814,\\x082023,\\x08the\\x08EC\\x08issued\\x08a\\x08Statement\\x08ofObjections\\x08(SO)\\x08informing Google\\x08of\\x08its\\npreliminary view that Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology.

In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys \\nGeneral and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and any final \\napproval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations \\ninto Google Play’s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play’s billing practices, including a \\nformal review in May 2022 of Google’s compliance with the new app store billing regulations. \\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate \\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nPrivacy Matters \\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy \\ninvestigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and litigation \\nin the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information and advertising practices, \\nwhich could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. \\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of \\nour products, services, and technologies infringe others’ intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may \\nsinclude awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from \\noffering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices \\nand develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm \\nour business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to \\nlitigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing \\ninfringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an \\nadverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating \\nworkarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain \\nintellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may \\nrequire that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and \\npartners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which \\ncould result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders \\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial \\ndisputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, \\npersonal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a \\nverdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play’s business. The presiding \\njudge will determine remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We plan to appeal. We also \\nperiodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. \\nThese claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in \\nsubstantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products \\nand services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse \\nconsequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have \\nbeen imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned \\nparties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\n78 Alphabet 2023 Annual Report\\nPart I Part II Part III Part IVNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject \\nmatter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our \\nproducts and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income \\ntaxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is \\nprobable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and \\njudicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.\\nSee, Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\\nNote 11.

We have also received \\ntax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas \\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\\n• Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, Google Play, \\nSearch, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer \\nsubscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps \\nand in-app purchases and devices.\\n• Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise \\ncustomers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received \\nfor Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise \\nservices.\\n• Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets \\nare generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and \\ndevices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature \\nof Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a \\nconsolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments \\nas a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\\nReflecting DeepMind’s increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in the \\nfirst quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet-level activities instead of within Other Bets. Additionally, \\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business \\nleaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current \\npresentation.\\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to \\nsignificantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within \\nAlphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was included \\nwithin Google Services.\\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily \\ninclude AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such \\nas our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including \\ncertain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space during 2023 were not \\nallocated to our segments.
